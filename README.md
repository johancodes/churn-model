# churn-model-app

This machine learning model predicts if a customer will leave a particular bank or not. It's trained on the bank's public dataset of 8000 rows, with parameters specific to the bank. The model has an accuracy of 80%. An endpoint was served on AWS by backend team.

Additional Notes:
- This is a Logistic Regression Model app that receives fresh data and outputs a prediction.
- Test the endpoint on your machine; download app.py and the two .pkl files.
- Test input data can be found in churn-model-development > model_creation.py file.
